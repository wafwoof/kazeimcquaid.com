        <h2>SOLANA COINS</h2>
        <p class="date">2024-03-21 @22:30:54</p>
        <p>
            I've been trying to figure out any strategy at all for making money off this new meme coin boom.
            I feel like I'm mentally disabled, it's as if I spent a year breathing mostly gas fumes. I understand
            the fundamentals of buy low, sell high, but I cannot spot indicators for shit. Every time I invest in something
            it immediately stagnates and goes up 30-40% absolute max, and then tanks the next hour. I feel at this point that
            statistics machine jesus or whatever the fuck is telling me not to do this anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have chinese dev boards coming in the mail with OLED screens and LoRa radios built in. I'm pretty excited about
            that I guess, but I always feel like I'm taking too long, like my few connections I've gained will cut me off just
            like every other time in life. It's only a matter of time it seems. But if you tell people these things it only
            exhasterbates problems. If you suddenly become better, sure, people love to see that. But in my case; I almost certainly
            will not "get better", I almost certainly will not learn anything cycle after cycle, and I'll probably die this way.
            But like with trading racist meme coins, (as much as I might want to) I will never have a sense for that moment... 
            I'll just kindof feel like that every day maybe until maybe I finally feel peace.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm going to eat some plain hotdogs and go to sleep. I will only be happy when I'm rich, and I can only become rich
            by overcoming my own missery and mental cloudiness. I am my own worst enemy. And I will likely fail.

            I need to relax or else I'm going to give myself a heart attack.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Here's just generally a few things I've been working on:</p>

                    <li>
                        Kinda fun I guess, idk just lots of small reworking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <li>
                        A tomagotchi clone that has proximity based interactions. Pets could be automatically traded with other users
                        when they are in close proximity to each other. Sorta like 3DS streetpass.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                a pretty big project that I can't talk about just yet...
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        ...but I am very excited! lots of vanilla JS and SCSS (interesting combo). The nesting and mobile queries in SCSS are so nice.
                        I still quite like vanilla CSS, but maybe that's because I hate myself.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            I will have more interesting things to say soon. Remember that things aren't so bad.

        <h2>AV COMPANY</h2>
        <p class="date">2024-03-09 @00:03:13</p>
        <p>I am the biggest fucking idiot of all time.</p>
        <p>
            I worked for <b>[COMPANY NAME REDACTED]</b> for a year-and-a-half before I put
            together that my coworkers were only just putting up with me and didn't were never going to invite me to anything.
            Would I have wanted to hangout with them? No, probably not. I, just like anybody else, like to be invited to things... But I am pretty
            uncomfortable in 75% of social situations. Why? Over and over, my friends have left me because of one reason or
            another, but it's almost always related to me not handling a social situation properly. Working at <b>[COMPANY NAME REDACTED]</b> 
            taught me a lot. I met new people (at the time), I wrote an iMessage interface (one of the 
            first of it's kind before beeper became a thing), I've operated shows for Dell Technologies, I've worked in the biggest property.
            Basically: I climbed the ladder pretty quickly. Eventually got an opportunity to work as a programmer in their XR (eXtended Reality)
            / webdev division... for the same amount of money as my AV work. Needless to say; when an opportunity came to run, I took it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I was the best employee that company had ever seen. I quite literally could do it all, and was working to improve systems in the company,
            but nobody cared. I was a tool to accomplish a job under-budget. They took advantage of me somewhat during a vulnerable time in my life.
            One day my boss took met me for a drink, and he told me that when I left, my coworkers would not remain my friends. I didn't believe him, 
            and I was wrong. He told me exactly what I needed to hear, but there was no way I could accept it at the time. And now that I have left
            the company, it's so obvious in hindsight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are good people in the world, but people change.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend who had brought me into the company, denied me fair treatment because
            of financial/social reasons. My boss's boss was a god damned liar, he promised me raises and what not in exchange for taking certain jobs,
            but he would then run from me in the warehouse, not answer calls, etc. I was in a bad spot and still did right by the people around me
            whenever I could. It didn't matter. Maybe I gained a reputation, but one of being cheap and easy to take advantage of.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It's late as hell and I'm tired. Good night moon.
