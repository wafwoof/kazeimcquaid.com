        <h2>AV COMPANY</h2>

        <p>
            I am the biggest fucking idiot of all time. I worked for this company for a year-and-a-half before I put
            together that my coworkers were only just putting up with me and didn't were never going to invite me to anything.
            Would I have wanted to? No, not really. I, just like anybody else, like to be invited to things. I weirdly obsess
            over it a little bit, but do not actually want to hang out with anyone who invites me to things, at least not usually.
            Perfect example; I got invited to hangout with a bunch of people tomorrow, accepted, and planned an excuse immediately.
            Why would I do this? Because, if a conversation isn't about engineering or technology, I get so bored I can't focus.
            If the internet has fried all of our attention-spans, then why are there no cool computer engineers like me to befriend?
            The answer is: people like me are all rich by now and have no real friends either. People like Tony Fadell. Tony Fadell
            definitely has friends you might say. How would he know? He's way too rich fulfilled by life to give a fuck about fake friends.
            Meanwhile, being poor, your main get out of life is social, and I'm smart enough to realize nobody is capable of being my friend.
            Or am I? It would seem like the opposite, seeing as how long it took me to realize that nobody likes me except smart people.

            As I type this I get less and less inteligable so this is where I will wrap it up.
