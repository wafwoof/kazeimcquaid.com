        <h2>COFFEE TABLE BOOKS</h2>
        <p class="date">2024-03-30 @02:46:50</p>
        <p>
            What do people need or want? One of the earliest ideas I came up with was a coffee table book, I must've been like 14 when I first
            thought of it. Virgil Abloh's "pyrex vision" tumblr blog kinda looked like that to me, a minimalistic mixed media coffee table bookified
            blog site. I've been kinda thinking about making something like that with a visual timeline of internet development and history. I
            think people would buy that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Levraging connections is one way to get a project off the ground, but I need to sharpen my point before I toss it at one of my connects.
            I don't want to bug people who have been very kind to me. I showed some people my idea for a telephone-sms chat interface for disabled people
            and phone bots, but there was little interest. I think it's a good idea, but needs to be shown to the correct people. Maybe Sam? Actually,
            that is not a terrible idea. I should show it to Sam.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to bed now, I have a lot of work to do tomorrow. I need to make a lot of money, and if I can do that by making great products,
            then I will be happy. I need to make something that people want, and I need to make it soon. I need to make something that people want,
            and I need to make it soon. I need to make something that people want, and I need to make it soon. I need to make something that people

        <h2>OUT OF IDEAS</h2>
        <p class="date">2024-03-23 @17:58:11</p>
        <p>
            Every day I wake up and realize I survived another day without making anything valuable. I need to make something to save myself.
            The tools are literally right in front of me. I have a computer, a phone, internet, a brain, and an amazing boss. And yet, every
            single fucking day I wake up in agony realizing I have to try to save myself and eventually I'll probably give up like every
            other day.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It's not that I can't think of anything, I have a few ideas like loragotchi might genuinely be cool. But everything has already
            been done. Everything has been tried already in some way, now we just have to wait for new technology to arise or become easier
            to use by the average person. But when tech becomes available, other people take the idea and use pragmatic thinking (as you should)
            to effectively do the same as you could do. And then I think: "maybe app development can be my niche", but that isn't an idea, I
            should be using the tools I already have (client & server web development stuff) but I can't think of shit to make on the web.
            I should be coming up with crypto ideas but it's just the same shit for each and every network. There's already like 5 GPU coins,
            they did alright on Ethereum so why not a Solana version (sigh). Everything else is just reinventing p2p file sharing, 
            trying to use ledgers as databases, packing wallet software onto an android phone, scamming with meme coins and social media, etc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So what do I do? Just wait for more web work? Fix other peoples work forever? I mean I love to help fix websites and whatnot, but
            it's not enough money to move, and I desperately need my own place. I need to live alone or I will die. Each day I spend not
            completely alone, saps energy that I desperately need to work on my escape plan. Stores are over-saturated. The only thing I can
            do is try to solve some sort of obscure hardware issue with microcontrollers and make them by hand. Chinese factories are too expensive
            for low-customer numbers like I currently have (0). I need to make something people want like the Floppy Emu, loragotchi is one but maybe
            a color e-ink tablet or something could be cool to make 40 of and sell for a good markup for labor. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Sometimes when I write like this I get motivated to keep working, but I know that feeling is temporary. Why would anybody buy a low
            yield product that's location based, yes LoRa has a 10km range but that still limits you to a city. How could I repurpose the tech?
            How can LoRa be used to make money? I don't fucking know, this is exactly it. I have good ideas but can't 'iPod-ify' it into a
            sellable product. Maybe something to check on your garden or compost? LoRa is well suited for p2p decentralized sorta stuff, but
            people aren't ready for and don't care about privacy. Please help me.

            I'm going to go to the store and then make steak and pan sauce. Maybe I could do something to do with food. Anyways, 
            here's my steak and pan sauce ingredient list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                steak (discount rib eye)
            </li>
            <li>
                dried thyme, garlic, salt/pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                stick of butter (1/2 for basting, 1/2 for sauce)
            </li>
            <li>
                wine (dry red)
            </li>
            <li>
                chicken (or beef) stock

        <h2>SOLANA COINS</h2>
        <p class="date">2024-03-21 @22:30:54</p>
        <p>
            I've been trying to figure out any strategy at all for making money off this new meme coin boom.
            I feel like I'm mentally disabled, it's as if I spent a year breathing mostly gas fumes. I understand
            the fundamentals of buy low, sell high, but I cannot spot indicators for shit. Every time I invest in something
            it immediately stagnates and goes up 30-40% absolute max, and then tanks the next hour. I feel at this point that
            statistics machine jesus or whatever the fuck is telling me not to do this anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have chinese dev boards coming in the mail with OLED screens and LoRa radios built in. I'm pretty excited about
            that I guess, but I always feel like I'm taking too long, like my few connections I've gained will cut me off just
            like every other time in life. It's only a matter of time it seems. But if you tell people these things it only
            exhasterbates problems. If you suddenly become better, sure, people love to see that. But in my case; I almost certainly
            will not "get better", I almost certainly will not learn anything cycle after cycle, and I'll probably die this way.
            But like with trading racist meme coins, (as much as I might want to) I will never have a sense for that moment... 
            I'll just kindof feel like that every day maybe until maybe I finally feel peace.

        <p>
            I'm going to eat some plain hotdogs and go to sleep. I will only be happy when I'm rich, and I can only become rich
            by overcoming my own missery and mental cloudiness. I am my own worst enemy. And I will likely fail.

        <h2>AV COMPANY</h2>
        <p class="date">2024-03-09 @00:03:13</p>
        <p>I am the biggest fucking idiot of all time.</p>
        <p>
            I worked for <b>[COMPANY NAME REDACTED]</b> for a year-and-a-half before I put
            together that my coworkers were only just putting up with me and didn't were never going to invite me to anything.
            Would I have wanted to hangout with them? No, probably not. I, just like anybody else, like to be invited to things... But I am pretty
            uncomfortable in 75% of social situations. Why? Over and over, my friends have left me because of one reason or
            another, but it's almost always related to me not handling a social situation properly. Working at <b>[COMPANY NAME REDACTED]</b> 
            taught me a lot. I met new people (at the time), I wrote an iMessage interface (one of the 
            first of it's kind before beeper became a thing), I've operated shows for Dell Technologies, I've worked in the biggest property.
            Basically: I climbed the ladder pretty quickly. Eventually got an opportunity to work as a programmer in their XR (eXtended Reality)
            / webdev division... for the same amount of money as my AV work. Needless to say; when an opportunity came to run, I took it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I was the best employee that company had ever seen. I quite literally could do it all, and was working to improve systems in the company,
            but nobody cared. I was a tool to accomplish a job under-budget. They took advantage of me somewhat during a vulnerable time in my life.
            One day my boss took met me for a drink, and he told me that when I left, my coworkers would not remain my friends. I didn't believe him, 
            and I was wrong. He told me exactly what I needed to hear, but there was no way I could accept it at the time. And now that I have left
            the company, it's so obvious in hindsight.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are good people in the world, but people change.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend who had brought me into the company, denied me fair treatment because
            of financial/social reasons. My boss's boss was a god damned liar, he promised me raises and what not in exchange for taking certain jobs,
            but he would then run from me in the warehouse, not answer calls, etc. I was in a bad spot and still did right by the people around me
            whenever I could. It didn't matter. Maybe I gained a reputation, but one of being cheap and easy to take advantage of.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It's late as hell and I'm tired. Good night moon.
